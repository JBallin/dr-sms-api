An API for doctor's offices to send SMS appointment reminders to patients, utilizing the Twilio API.

Built during a 4-hour hackathon at Galvanize (Bootcamp) where we had to use a 3rd-party API.

While ideating, a doctor called a couple times just to notify me of an upcoming appointment...we decided to create a simple form that would allow the office to save time spent dialing patients and provide a more convenient reminder medium for patients.

This project has a POST /sms endpoint that accepts a body from a form, which is used to send an SMS to the patient.
